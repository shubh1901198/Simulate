## 📦 Container Registry – GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

This project uses **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** to store and version Docker images
used for Kubernetes-based simulation jobs.

### Why GHCR?
- Native integration with GitHub Actions
- No external registry credentials required
- Secure, versioned container storage
- Ideal for CI/CD and Kubernetes workflows

### Image Publishing Flow
1. Docker image is built using GitHub Actions
2. Image is pushed to GHCR as a container package
3. Each commit is tagged for traceability
4. Image is deployed to a local KinD Kubernetes cluster

### Example Image Tags
```text
ghcr.io/<org>/trip-simulation:latest
ghcr.io/<org>/trip-simulation:<commit-sha>
